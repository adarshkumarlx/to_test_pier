Only routing over solid planes are permissible.

During each via transition, it is imperative that return vias are placed symmetrically close to the data vias. Ensure minimal routing imbalances when traces are routed in/out from the via to reduce impedance imbalance i.e uniformity of spacing between wire A,B and C.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>CSI port use preference</p></entry><entry><p>If some of the CSI ports are not used, it must have CSI_A as one of the used ports.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Loss numbers </p></entry><entry><p>1. PCB Loss number assumed: -0.42 dB/inch (worst case) at 1.25 GHz.</p><p>2. FPC cable loss number assumed: -0.316 dB/inch (worst case) at 1.25 GHz.</p><p>3. Cable length guideline is based on FPC cable. FPC cable loss should be within the loss number specified above. If micro-Coax is used, cable length can be longer as micro-Coax loss, for example 40 AWG cable has a loss of -0.15 dB/inch at 1.25 GHz. </p><p>Please note that Cable loss numbers are general guidelines and actual numbers may be different due to the dimensions, type of material used.</p><p>(Refer to the individual topologies for total loss numbers). These loss number take precedence over length mentioned in individual topologies below specially while using lower loss cable options like micro coaxial cables.</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></section></body></topic>
