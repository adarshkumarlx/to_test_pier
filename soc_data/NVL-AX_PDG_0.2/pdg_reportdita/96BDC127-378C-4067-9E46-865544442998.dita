The broad categories of consideration in mechanical design are chassis design, connector selection and grounding, high speed cable design and grounding. </p><ul><li><p>All faces of the chassis should have a conductive EMI coating (in cases where metallic chassis is not used) to provide RF shielding. The sidewalls of the chassis should also have a continuous EMI coating. </p></li><li><p>Conductive contacts between the faces of the chassis are required to reduce the size of the openings along the chassis seams (the faces of the chassis should make continuous electrical contact). </p></li><li><p>Avoid non-conductive coating/paint on screws that are used to secure the motherboard to the chassis or used between chassis faces and expose solder mask on the PCB for the screws to make contact to the PCB ground layers. </p></li><li><p>Large metal parts of the system should be connected to chassis ground at more than one point.  Examples of large metal parts include the PCB ground layers, chassis, metal frame of the display, metal casing of the camera modules, FPC cables, etc. Conductive gaskets or screws may be used to tie large metal structures together at multiple contact points. </p></li><li><p>The thermal solution (heat pipe, cold plate) should be grounded to eliminate or reduce any resonance effects that could couple noise in the vicinity of the thermal solution.  </p></li><li><p>Refer to Intel White Paper #602554 for further guidelines on the EMI coating thickness and selection criteria, conductive contact between chassis faces and thermal solution grounding. </p></li><li><p>The figures below illustrate the guidance for chassis design considerations:</p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_emi_coating_on_chassis_covers_and_sidewalls_1"><title>EMI Coating on Chassis Covers and Sidewalls</title><image href="FIG_emi coating on chassis covers and sidewalls_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_emi_coating_on_chassis_covers_and_sidewalls_1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_faces_of_the_chassis_should_make_continuous_electrical_contact_1"><title>Faces of the Chassis should make Continuous Electrical Contact</title><image href="FIG_faces of the chassis should make continuous electrical contact_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_faces_of_the_chassis_should_make_continuous_electrical_contact_1_jpg" /></fig><fig id="FIG_thermal_solution_grounding_1"><title>Thermal Solution Grounding</title><image href="FIG_thermal solution grounding_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_thermal_solution_grounding_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
