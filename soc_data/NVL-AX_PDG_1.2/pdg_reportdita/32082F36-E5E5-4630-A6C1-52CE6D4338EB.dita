As per specification, normal DP to DP monitor cable assembly should not connect this across the cable. Non-compliant cables in the market have them as direct connection. This results in Display monitor back driving current to the motherboard and causing system malfunction during power on or when waking-up from sleep state.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Back drive prevention</p></entry><entry><p>Add a back driver protection circuit (FET) as shown above on the DP_PWR pin 20 of the DP connector.
