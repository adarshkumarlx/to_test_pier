Internal cables should be well shielded to reduce the noise radiation from it. </p><p>The following are key considerations while selecting and designing with internal cables (FPC/FFC): </p><ul><li><p>The internal cable should be shielded with either full ground layers on top and bottom, or by using an EMI shielding film (silk screening with silver/copper ink, aluminum/copper film lamination). </p></li><li><p>For the shield to be effective, the shield layer should not be floating as a floating shield does not provide a return current path and may even make the noise radiation worse. To improve the ground contact of the shield, a direct PCB ground or chassis ground connection of the shield is recommended. Multiple grounding points may be needed for long FPCs (typically every 50mm) </p></li><li><p>The routing of the internal cables is also critical to reducing the amount of noise that can couple to the sensitive circuits. For further guidelines on cable routing, refer to Intel White Paper #602554.</p></li><li><p>The figures below illustrate the guidance for internal cable shielding and grounding </p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_internal_cable_design_criteria_for_emi_1"><title>Internal Cable Design Criteria for EMI</title><image href="FIG_internal cable design criteria for emi_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_internal_cable_design_criteria_for_emi_1_jpg" /></fig><fig id="FIG_direct_pcb_or_chassis_ground_connection_of_the_cable_shield_1"><title>Direct PCB or Chassis Ground Connection of the Cable Shield</title><image href="FIG_direct pcb or chassis ground connection of the cable shield_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_direct_pcb_or_chassis_ground_connection_of_the_cable_shield_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
