It is recommended to have stitching capacitors (0.1 uF, 0402 or smaller) to bridge the two reference planes and provide current return path and the stitching capacitor must be placed as close as possible to the signal trace.</p><fig id="FIG_reduce_signal_referencing_discontinuities_impact_1"><title>Reduce Signal Referencing Discontinuities Impact</title><image href="FIG_reduce signal referencing discontinuities impact_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_reduce_signal_referencing_discontinuities_impact_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
