Noise leakage observed in the seams, slots and between metal-to-metal bonding. Antenna barricade, metal enclosure around antenna, is an effective solution to mitigate RFI noise at platform level by physically and electromagnetically isolating the antenna from potential sources of interference. Experimental data shows ~10 dB noise reduction with antenna barricade. To avoid any opening/leakage EMI gasket material between barricade and chassis can be applied at multiple locations. However, antenna barricade needs to be planned upfront as it is part of chassis design. </p><p>Intel has developed a license technology on antenna barricade technology and design.
