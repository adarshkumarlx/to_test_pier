Noise could couple to the platform antenna hence reducing the radios performance like throughput, latency, and sensitivity by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</p><p>This section provides the RF platform noise threshold that can set the baseline for determining if the noise level in the radio bands is tolerable to maintain wireless performance, therefore ensuring the best user experience. To meet the noise requirement, customers could implement the mitigation solutions illustrated in the EMC General Considerations guidelines.</p></section></body></topic>
