To further optimize selection of ESD diode, customers may consider using SEED simulation concept during system design phase.

SEED defines an ESD robustness design concept that assures matching between PCB protection components and IC IO behavior during system ESD discharges event. It allows selection of ESD diode which is optimized based on IO characteristics and PCB design. It also promotes early assessment using a simulation to achieve first-time-right PCB design.  This design concept applies to hot plug input/output port applications, that includes USB2, USB3, Type-C, DisplayPort, and HDMI.</p><fig id="FIG_seed_block_diagram_1"><title>SEED Block Diagram</title><image href="FIG_seed block diagram_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_seed_block_diagram_1_jpg" /></fig><p>SEED simulation deck is available in Advanced Design System (ADS) and HSPICE. Refer to Intel System Efficient ESD Design (SEED) Models User Guide (#702999) for step-by-step simulation guidance. Customers may contact the Intel representative for platform specific SEED Models.
