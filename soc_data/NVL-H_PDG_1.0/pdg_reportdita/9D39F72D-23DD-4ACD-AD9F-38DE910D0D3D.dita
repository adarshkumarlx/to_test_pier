These decoupling capacitors may help in reducing potential NPU noise in certain scenarios such as a system with aggressive antenna placement to NPU power plane. The following table and figure show the recommended values and placement for the decoupling capacitors:</p><fig id="FIG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_npu_power_plane_1"><title>RF Decoupling Capacitor Guideline for NPU Power Plane</title><image href="FIG_rf decoupling capacitor guideline for npu power plane_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_npu_power_plane_1_png" /></fig><table id="TABLE_9D39F72D-23DD-4ACD-AD9F-38DE910D0D3D_1"><title>NPU Power Plane RF Capacitor Placement Guidelines</title><tgroup cols="4"><thead><row><entry>Case #</entry><entry>Location of Decoupling Capacitor</entry><entry>NPU RF Capacitors for 2.4GHz Band</entry><entry>Comments</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><p>Case 1</p></entry><entry><p>Directly underneath pair of NPU power via and GND vias (Directly from BGAs) on the plane</p></entry><entry><p>0201 size: 6 x capacitors (Suggested value: between 22pF to 33pF)</p></entry><entry><p>Preferred placement for RF decoupling capacitors.
Capacitors are recommended to be placed directly underneath the pair of NPU power via - GND vias at bottom layer or at least within the processor’s shadow area. The value of the RF capacitor may need to be tuned with respect to the potential unintended RF power within Wi-Fi bands. </p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Case 2</p></entry><entry><p>≤ 5mm from NPU power via BGA </p></entry><entry><p>0201 size: 6 x capacitors (Suggested value: between 22pF to 33pF) </p></entry><entry><p>The value of the RF capacitor may need to be tuned with respect to the potential unintended RF power within Wi-Fi bands.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Case 3 (Not Recommended)</p></entry><entry><p>&gt; 5mm away from NPU power via BGA </p></entry><entry><p>Not recommended </p></entry><entry><p>RF capacitors are NOT effective for RFI reduction in this location of placement.</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></section></body></topic>
