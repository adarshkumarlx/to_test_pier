Poor grounding contact or gaps/seams in the shield can reduce the shielding effectiveness. Also, the size of any aperture and opening in a mechanical shield enclosure needs to be minimized, keeping it smaller than 2.5 mm. A conductive gasket can also be used to ground the shield to the PCB.</p><p>The following figure shows a general recommendation for spacing between grounding vias (S). The general recommendation is to use via spacing ≤ λ/6 (e.g., approximately 4 mm for 7.5 GHz). To improve shielding effectiveness, use closer spacing. </p><fig id="FIG_on-board_shield_grounding_general_guideline_1"><title>On-Board Shield Grounding General Guideline</title><image href="FIG_on-board shield grounding general guideline_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_on-board_shield_grounding_general_guideline_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
