Prioritizing embedding VDDQ over VDD2.  For more details, refer to “Power Integrity Recommendations” to embed these power planes. Minimize exposure of memory power plane size on top and bottom layer of the board and keeping minimum routing for BGA and capacitors only.  </p><p>If embedding memory power plane is not possible, please consider either one of the following recommendations: </p><ul><li><p>Option 1: Consider covering exposed memory power planes with shield or absorber.</p></li><li><p>Option 2: Consider adding placeholders for platform RF capacitors to mitigate power plane noise. Refer to the figures and guidelines below. </p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_exposed_memory_power_plane_rf_decoupling_capacitors_1"><title>Exposed Memory Power Plane RF Decoupling Capacitors</title><image href="FIG_exposed memory power plane rf decoupling capacitors_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_exposed_memory_power_plane_rf_decoupling_capacitors_1_png" /></fig><p>RF decoupling capacitors placement in processor area:</p><ul><li><p>12pF (0402) or 15pF (0201) </p></li><li><p>&lt; 4 mm proximity from BGA of processor memory power plane</p></li><li><p>2 to 3 capacitors are recommended</p></li><li><p>Reserve as placeholder (capacitors unstuffed)</p></li></ul><p>RF decoupling capacitors placement in memory module area:</p><ul><li><p>12pF (0402) or 15pF (0201) </p></li><li><p>&lt; 4 mm proximity from pins of memory devices</p></li><li><p>At least 2 capacitors per memory module</p></li><li><p>Reserve as placeholder (capacitors unstuffed)</p></li></ul><p>2.4 GHz band effective RF capacitor values are to be found by RF interference measurements as their effectiveness depends on RF capacitor size, locations, number, and pad and via parasitic.
