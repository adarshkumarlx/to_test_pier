Radiated power from internal WWAN and WLAN antennas as well as from external WWAN/ WLAN devices placed near the platform can couple to the crystal and corrupt the clock signal causing issues such as screen flickering and system hang. Similarly, the crystal used with the Thunderbolt retimer is very sensitive to RF power, and noise from nearby antennas can result in connection loss with the device plugged into the Thunderbolt port. Refer to retimer collaterals in the EMC/RF Reference Documents section for XTAL specifications. The following RF Immunity Guidelines apply to both the 38.4 MHz crystal, RTC (real-time clock) crystal as well as the Thunderbolt retimer crystal.</p><ul><li><p>Follow crystal routing guidelines very carefully. (Refer to XTAL section under High Speed I/Os chapter).</p></li><li><p>Implement a ground ring surrounding crystal and related components. Refer to the figure below. Do not connect external load caps to GND ring, but rather directly to GND plane on adjacent layer.</p></li><li><p>Use a shielded crystal component.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that clock and high-speed I/O traces are not routed in proximity to the crystal components and traces (XTAL_IN/OUT).</p></li><li><p>Place crystal far away from antennas and potential RF power coupling paths such as unshielded/ungrounded cables. The exact distance needed depends on the platform design. Platforms without board shield may have higher risk.</p></li><li><p>Chassis shielding and design plays a critical role in RF immunity. Refer to the EMC Mechanical Considerations section and collateral #602554.</p></li></ul><p>The following RF guidelines apply to RTC (real-time) crystal:</p><ul><li><p>Reserve a placeholder for the RF cap on the power plane for RTC. The capacitance of the stuffed RF cap can be tuned with respect to the potential unintended RF power. The footprint should be as close as possible to processor side.</p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_rf_capacitor_placement_recommendation_for_rtc_crystal_1"><title>RF Capacitor Placement Recommendation for RTC Crystal</title><image href="FIG_rf capacitor placement recommendation for rtc crystal_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_rf_capacitor_placement_recommendation_for_rtc_crystal_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
