Note
"Routing Notes for CSI CPHY: (1) CPHY must be routed as a trio (2) If the port is supposed to support both CPHY and DPHY, it must be routed following CPHY guidelines (3) CPHY impedance target is 40 ohms single ended and 80 ohms differential (4) All traces in trio must follow same trace width (5) Intra-Pair guidelines must be used for trace to trace spacing in a trio (6) S-ES guidelines must be used for trio to trio in the same port (7) S-Non-ES must be used for port to port or CPHY to other interface (8) CSI CPHY in Microstrip (MS) routing is not recommended for long length, allowed only for short length (<5 mm) near the connector."
"For CNVio3 signal spacing: CNVio3 to non-CNVio3 pair spacing of 10H (H=Dielectric Thickness) is required. If this cannot be achieved, then GND shielding with proper stitching vias and 3H minimum spacing from GND shielding to CNVio3 is required. Please also refer to ""CNVio3 Spacing Recommendation"" diagram in CNVio3 section."
