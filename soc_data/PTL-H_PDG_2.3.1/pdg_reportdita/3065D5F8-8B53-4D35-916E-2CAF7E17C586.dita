This demonstrated EMI shield covers the entire core area, including DRAM subsystem, CPU, and power delivery circuits in Type-3 PCB and is an example of the co-design of active thermal and EMI shield solutions. For key implementation principals and PCB design aspects of this shield, please refer to the Intel whitepaper # 621488, "New DRAM Technology and Compelling EMI Shield Mitigation Solutions Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) Analysis"</p><fig id="FIG_reference_platform_with_emi_shield_solution_1"><title>Reference Platform with EMI Shield Solution</title><image href="FIG_reference platform with emi shield solution_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_reference_platform_with_emi_shield_solution_1_jpg" /></fig><fig id="FIG_emi_gasket_surround_shield_and_connect_to_board_ground_pad_opening_1"><title>EMI Gasket Surround Shield and Connect to Board Ground Pad Opening</title><image href="FIG_emi gasket surround shield and connect to board ground pad opening_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_emi_gasket_surround_shield_and_connect_to_board_ground_pad_opening_1_jpg" /></fig><p>In the using of fabric-over-foam gasket in making connection between shielding lid and frame or between shielding can and PCB, a minimum of 20% or higher compression should be considered in ensuring the electrical effectiveness. Components height and distance from shielding solution depends on heat pipe routing and system thermal &amp; mechanical design. Shielding solution inclusive of compressed gasket should avoid physical collision and interference with components.

Shielding design should consider sufficient screws in provide effective mechanical force in the shielding mating or closure. Screw size, count and contact subject to PCB thickness, gasket interface and shielding material. Structure analysis required in ensuring the thermal/ EMI shielding provides appropriate/ uniform pressure on die, and ensuring good gasket stiffness and proper electrical contact of gasket towards PCB GND.
