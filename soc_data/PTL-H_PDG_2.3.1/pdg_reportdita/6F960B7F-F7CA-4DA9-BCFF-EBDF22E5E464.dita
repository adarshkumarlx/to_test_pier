Routing cables close to the aggressor like DDR, HSIO, and SSD, could result in critical radio frequency interference (RFI) and EMI (regulatory) issues. For further guidelines on cable routing, refer to Intel White Paper #602554.</p><p>Cable and connector shielding</p><ul><li><p>A shielded micro-coax cable assembly or 3-layer FPC cable are recommended for high-speed signals.</p></li><li><p>The method by which the shield layers of a cable are well contacted to ground has a significant impact on mitigating the noise radiation. A floating shield layer does not provide a return current path and may even make the noise radiation worse. </p></li><li><p>The shield layer(s) of the cable should make contact to the plug shell (ground) of the cable.</p></li><li><p>In addition, the receptacle of the cable should have ground contact to the PCB ground at multiple locations or to the chassis through the gasket.</p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_grounding_scheme_for_internal_cable_and_connector_1"><title>Grounding Scheme for Internal Cable and Connector</title><image href="FIG_grounding scheme for internal cable and connector_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_grounding_scheme_for_internal_cable_and_connector_1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_examples_of_ground_contacts_on_the_receptacle_of_the_cable_and_connector_1"><title>Examples of ground contacts on the receptacle of the cable and connector</title><image href="FIG_examples of ground contacts on the receptacle of the cable and connector_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_examples_of_ground_contacts_on_the_receptacle_of_the_cable_and_connector_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
