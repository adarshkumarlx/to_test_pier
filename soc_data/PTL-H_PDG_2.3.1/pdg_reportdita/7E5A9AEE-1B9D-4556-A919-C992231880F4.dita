These decoupling capacitors may help in reducing potential GFX noise in certain scenarios such as a system with aggressive antenna placement to GFX power planes. The following table and figure show the recommended values and placement for the decoupling capacitors:</p><fig id="FIG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_gfx_power_planes_1"><title>RF Decoupling Capacitor Guideline for GFX Power Planes</title><image href="FIG_rf decoupling capacitor guideline for gfx power planes_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_gfx_power_planes_1_png" /></fig><table id="TABLE_7E5A9AEE-1B9D-4556-A919-C992231880F4_1"><title>Graphic Power Plane RF Capacitor Placement Guidelines</title><tgroup cols="4"><thead><row><entry>Case #</entry><entry>Location of Decoupling Capacitor</entry><entry>GFX RF Capacitors for 2.4GHz Band</entry><entry>Comments</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><p>Case 1</p></entry><entry><p>Directly underneath pair of GFX power via and GND vias (Directly from BGAs) on the plane</p></entry><entry><p>0201 size: 6 x capacitors (Suggested value: between 22pF to 33pF)</p></entry><entry><p>Preferred placement for RF decoupling capacitors.
Capacitors are recommended to be placed directly underneath the pair of GFX power via - GND vias at bottom layer or at least within the CPU’s shadow area. The value of the RF capacitor may need to be tuned with respect to the potential unintended RF power within Wi-Fi bands.
