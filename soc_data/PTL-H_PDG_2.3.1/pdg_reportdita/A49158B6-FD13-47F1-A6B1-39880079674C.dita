The purpose of the white paper is to promote antenna barricade technology and to explain how to design effective barricades using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi antennas. This technology contrasts to conventional EMI shields that are applied to motherboard platform noise sources. The design choice (antenna barricade, conventional EMI shields, or the combination of two) has to be made before chassis designs where barricade or metallic wall is formed as shown in the whitepaper.
10~15 dB RFI reduction is achieved using antenna barricade across entire Wi-Fi frequency bands up to 7.125 GHz. 
Barricade technique can provide several advantages over conventional on-board EMI shields:
</p><ul><li><p>Relatively easy to achieve high broadband RFI shielding effectiveness with low BOM cost.</p></li><li><p>No dependency on heat solutions (active, passive) or PCB technology (Type-3 or Type-4).</p></li></ul><p>A legal agreement is required to use the Intel Antenna Barricade Technology.
