Extra 8 Tx and 8 Rx lanes are available in PTL-H484 SKU (namely D13 to D20) only. Those extra 8 lanes (D13 to D20) lanes are no connect in package for PTL-H404 and PTL-H12Xe SKUs. </p><fig id="FIG_pcie5_board_layout_recommendation_ac_cap_voiding__1"><title>PCIE5 Board Layout Recommendation AC Cap Voiding </title><image href="FIG_pcie5 board layout recommendation ac cap voiding _1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_pcie5_board_layout_recommendation_ac_cap_voiding__1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_void_above_and_below_buried_vias_pth_pads_in_t4_stackups_1"><title>Void above and below buried vias PTH pads in T4 stackups</title><image href="FIG_void above and below buried vias pth pads in t4 stackups_1.JPG" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_void_above_and_below_buried_vias_pth_pads_in_t4_stackups_1_JPG" /></fig><fig id="FIG_void_under_soc_ball_pads_1"><title>Void under SOC ball pads</title><image href="FIG_void under soc ball pads_1.JPG" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_void_under_soc_ball_pads_1_JPG" /></fig><table id="TABLE_E9E25AD0-8B7E-4DAE-A4F6-5694F4528412_1"><title>PCIe Gen 5 General Guidelines</title><tgroup cols="2"><thead><row><entry>Note</entry><entry>Detail</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><p>Voiding recommendation</p></entry><entry><p>It is recommended to void unused (non-functional) pads for differential vias and pin pads for ESDs, AC caps and connectors to optimize the impedance matching in the channel.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>PCIe5 AC capacitor size</p></entry><entry><p>It is required to use 0201 .</p><p>Void reference layer under pad size of differential cap together. </p><p>Extend void by 50um (2 mils) on all sides of pads. </p><p>Reference example provided per figure.</p><p>Ensure spacing between P and N cap is about ~305 um (~12 mils) and spacing between caps of different pair caps is more than 762 um (30 mils).</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Unused signals</p></entry><entry><p>Unused data signals should be left as no connect at the ball.</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Interleaved requirement</p></entry><entry><p>Prefer non-interleaved routing.
