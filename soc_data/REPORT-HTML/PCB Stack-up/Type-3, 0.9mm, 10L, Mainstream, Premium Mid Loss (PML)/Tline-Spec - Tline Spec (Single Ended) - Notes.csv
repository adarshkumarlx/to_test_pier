Note
"Based on Tline Spec (Single Ended) table recommendation, the CLK - Any (um) spacing requirement shall be applicable for; 	
1) CLK to DATA signals on similar signaling group 	
2) CLK to DATA and CLK signals from other signaling group  

For CLK to non-toggling signals, the spacing between the CLK to others can be relaxed and used the DATA - Any (um) spacing requirement.  

Please refer to ""TBD_PTL_UH_Proc_Line_BGA_Pkg_Ballout_Mech_Spec_Revxpx.xlsx"" on the Pinlist for non-toggling signals."
