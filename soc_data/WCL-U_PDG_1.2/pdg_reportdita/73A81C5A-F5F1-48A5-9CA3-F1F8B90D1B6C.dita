Refer to Intel White Paper #602554 for guidelines on the coating thickness and selection criteria.</p><fig id="FIG_emi_coating_on_non_metallic_chassis_1"><title>EMI Coating on Non Metallic Chassis</title><image href="FIG_emi coating on non metallic chassis_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_emi_coating_on_non_metallic_chassis_1_jpg" /></fig><p>Conductive contacts along the mating interface between two covers of the chassis are required to reduce the size of the openings between chassis covers. Left figure below shows the chassis contact impact between the ‘C’ and ‘D’ faces of the chassis. Mounting holes for screws that are used to secure the motherboard to the chassis or between chassis faces should not have non-conductive coating and the PCB solder mask exposed for the screw to make contact to the PCB ground. The metal back-plate of the LCD screen and back-plate of the keyboard should not be left as a floating metal, and they should be properly grounded. Refer to Intel White Paper #602554 for further guidance on the contact between chassis faces. </p><fig id="FIG_conductive_contacts_for_chassis_faces_and_pcb_ground_1"><title>Conductive Contacts for Chassis Faces and PCB Ground</title><image href="FIG_conductive contacts for chassis faces and pcb ground_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_conductive_contacts_for_chassis_faces_and_pcb_ground_1_jpg" /></fig><p>The metal shell of IO connectors, such as USB3, HDMI etc. should make contact to the chassis either using EMI gaskets of metal fingers in the chassis. Figure in right shows a block diagram of gasket making connection between IO connector and chassis. For the commonly used fabric-over-foam gaskets to be effective, a minimum of 20% or higher compression is required.</p><fig id="FIG_gasket_with_compression_to_connect_io_connector_and_chassis_1"><title>Gasket with Compression to Connect IO Connector and Chassis</title><image href="FIG_gasket with compression to connect io connector and chassis_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_gasket_with_compression_to_connect_io_connector_and_chassis_1_jpg" /></fig><p>The receptacle connector should have good area of contact to the printed circuit board.

EMI gasket material can be applied to ground the thermal solution at multiple locations (either to PCB ground or chassis ground). Grounding near the fins is also recommended. Refer to Intel White Paper #602554 for further guidance on the thermal solution grounding.</p><fig id="FIG_thermal_solution_grounding_1"><title>Thermal Solution Grounding</title><image href="FIG_thermal solution grounding_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_thermal_solution_grounding_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
