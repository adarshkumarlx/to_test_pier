Radiated power from internal WWAN and WLAN antennas as well as from external WWAN/ WLAN devices placed near the platform can couple to the crystal and corrupt the clock signal causing issues such as screen flickering and system hang. Similarly the crystal used with the Thunderbolt retimer is very sensitive to RF power, and noise from nearby antennas can result in connection loss with the device plugged into the Thunderbolt port. Refer to retimer collaterals (document number: #572046) for XTAL specifications. The following RF Immunity Guidelines apply to both the 38.4 MHz crystal, RTC (real-time clock) crystal as well as the Thunderbolt/ retimer crystal.</p><ul><li><p>Follow crystal routing guidelines very carefully. (Refer to XTAL design guidelines section).</p></li><li><p>Implement a ground ring surrounding crystal and related components. Refer to below figure. Do not connect external load caps to GND ring, but rather directly to GND plane on adjacent layer.</p></li><li><p>Use a shielded crystal component.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that external high speed IO ( USB3.x/2/1.x) and internal high speed IO (PCIe) traces are not routed in close proximity to the crystal components and traces (XTAL_IN/OUT).</p></li><li><p>Place crystal far away from antennas and potential RF power coupling paths such as unshielded/ungrounded cables. Exact distance needed depends on platform design. Platforms without board shield may have higher risk.</p></li><li><p>Chassis shielding and design plays a critical role in RF immunity. Refer to the EMC Mechanical Considerations section and collateral #602554.</p></li></ul><p>The following RF guideline apply to RTC (real-time) crystal</p><ul><li><p>Design a footprint for the RF capacitor on the power plane (+Vcc1p5_RTC) for RTC. The capacitance of the stuffed RF capacitor should be tuned with respect to the potential unintended RF power. The footprint should be as close as possible to CPU side.</p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_rf_capacitor_placement_recommendation_for_rtc_crystal_1"><title>RF capacitor placement recommendation for RTC crystal</title><image href="FIG_rf capacitor placement recommendation for rtc crystal_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_rf_capacitor_placement_recommendation_for_rtc_crystal_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
