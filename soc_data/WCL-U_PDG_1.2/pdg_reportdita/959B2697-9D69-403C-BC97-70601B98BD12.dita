This is referred to as radio frequency interference and results is degraded signal to noise ratio at the input to the radio receiver. The degraded SNR will impact the data throughput as well as range on the wireless link.</p><p>Different noise sources from the platform will have different frequency spectrum. For example, a scrambled signal, such as USB3 will appear with broadband frequency content ranging from DC to 5 GHz. A clock signal, on the other hand will result in single-tone (narrow band) peaks at the harmonic frequencies of the clock frequency.</p></section></body></topic>
