Proper ground contact of the shield is critical to ensuring shielding effectiveness. In consideration of (Î»/10) @ 7.5 GHz, the following figure shows the maximum recommended spacing between grounding pads and vias. Poor grounding contact or gaps/ seams in the shield can reduce the shielding effectiveness.</p><fig id="FIG_on_board_shielding_guidelines_1"><title>On Board Shielding Guidelines</title><image href="FIG_on board shielding guidelines_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_on_board_shielding_guidelines_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
