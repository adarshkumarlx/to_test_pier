This design requires the use of a taller fence, electrically conductive gasket and a conductive case or conductive coated case. The conductive case can be achieved using a metallic case or a conductive coatings over a plastic chassis. The figure below shows an example implementation of this shield concept. Note: EMI Lidless shielding implementation shall include system thermal and airflow design consideration. </p><fig id="FIG_example_implementation_of_lidless_shielding_solution_concept_1"><title>Example Implementation of Lidless Shielding Solution Concept</title><image href="FIG_example implementation of lidless shielding solution concept_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_example_implementation_of_lidless_shielding_solution_concept_1_jpg" /></fig><p>Air flow to the enclosure and mechanical strength of the shielding are factors of the shield. Balanced trade off is required for air ventilation hole for thermal conductivity and RF shielding effectiveness.  An example of optimized ventilation and effective RF shielding fence is illustrated in figure below.</p><fig id="FIG_trade-off_between_air_flow_ventilation_and_rf_shielding_effectiveness_1"><title>Trade-off between Air Flow Ventilation and RF Shielding Effectiveness</title><image href="FIG_trade-off between air flow ventilation and rf shielding effectiveness_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_trade-off_between_air_flow_ventilation_and_rf_shielding_effectiveness_1_jpg" /></fig><p>An opening in the fence allows the heat pipe to go through it, however the heat pipe must be grounded and the space between the fence and heat pipe needs to be sealed. Flexible gasket is a good option to fill the spaces, especially in complex geometries. This gasket helps to avoid rigid unions and geometry irregularities. Refer to the supplierÂ´s data sheet to determine the requirements to achieve the electrical conductivity (percentage of compression required).The flexible gasket can be used to seal irregular components such as heat pipes or other complex geometries. When the gasket is compressed, lateral expansion can occur, which should be considered as part of the design. KOZ requirements with respect to electrical components may be needed to avoid  short circuits. </p><fig id="FIG_flexible_conductive_gasket_for_enclosure__1"><title>Flexible Conductive Gasket for Enclosure </title><image href="FIG_flexible conductive gasket for enclosure _1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_flexible_conductive_gasket_for_enclosure__1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
