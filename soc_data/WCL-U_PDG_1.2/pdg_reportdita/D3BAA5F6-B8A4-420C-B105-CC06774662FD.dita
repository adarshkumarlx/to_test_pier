DRAM, SODIMM) can radiate broadband and narrowband RFI noise and may cause radio frequency interference. A combination of EMI shield and antenna placement is required to mitigate noise from memory devices.</p><p>SODIMM memory devices can cause higher RFI noise than the soldered down DRAM devices and it is highly recommended to use an EMI shield for the SODIMM memory devices.</p><p>Refer to the sections “On-Board Shielding” and “Intel DDR RFI Mitigation (RFIM) Software Feature” for more information.</p></section></body></topic>
