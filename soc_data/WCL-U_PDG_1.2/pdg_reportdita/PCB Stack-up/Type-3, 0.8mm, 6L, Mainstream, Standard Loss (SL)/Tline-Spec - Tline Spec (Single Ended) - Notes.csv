Note
"Based on Tline Spec (Single Ended) table recommendation, the CLK - Any (um) spacing requirement shall be applicable for:
1) CLK to DATA signals on similar signaling group 
2) CLK to DATA signals from other signaling group
3) CLK to CLK signals from other signaling group 
For CLK to pseudo static signals, the spacing between the CLK to others can be relaxed and used the DATA - Any (um) spacing requirement. 
Example of pseudo static signal: RESET, ALERT, Chip Select (CS), Request (REQ), INTERRUPT, INIT."
