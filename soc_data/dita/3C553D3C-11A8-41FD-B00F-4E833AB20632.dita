While the data rates increase, the high-frequency data and clocks generate RF noise that falls into Wi-Fi radio bands. Besides RF noise from eDP, timing controller (TCON), used to convert the eDP signal and drive the individual pixels of the display, could be another source of interference. </p></section><section id="SECTION_FBCCE6A6-F637-42ED-B61C-DBE9ACA5CB31"><title>Narrowband Spur Noise from eDP Data and TCON Clock</title><p>To prevent interference with radio bands, select the eDP data rates that ensure the fundamental frequencies and harmonics of the eDP signals do not fall into Wi-Fi radio bands. The data rates 2.43 Gbps and 6.75 Gbps should be avoided to mitigate the RF noise impact on Wi-Fi radios. Hence, display panels supporting 2.7/8.1 Gbps should be chosen. Other mitigation solutions such as using high-quality shielding cable for eDP and TCON connection/board or enabling spread spectrum clocking may provide effective but limited noise reduction as an alternative solution. </p><fig id="FIG_mitigate_rf_interference_by_preventing_using_data_rate_falling_into_wi-fi_radios_1"><title>Mitigate RF interference by preventing using data rate falling into Wi-Fi radios</title><image href="FIG_mitigate rf interference by preventing using data rate falling into wi-fi radios_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_mitigate_rf_interference_by_preventing_using_data_rate_falling_into_wi-fi_radios_1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_tcon_clock_noise_falling_into_wi-fi_bands_1"><title>TCON clock noise falling into Wi-Fi bands</title><image href="FIG_tcon clock noise falling into wi-fi bands_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_tcon_clock_noise_falling_into_wi-fi_bands_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
