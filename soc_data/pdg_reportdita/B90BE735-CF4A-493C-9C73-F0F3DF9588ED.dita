Following are two examples of ESD entry points and mitigation methods:</p><ul><li><p>Example 1: Speaker openings - In systems with metal mesh for the speaker openings, the ESD energy can be diverted to the system ground by connecting the metal mesh to system ground. This will minimize the ESD entry through the speaker lines into the PCB. </p></li><li><p>Example 2: SIM/SD trays - SIM/SD cards are very sensitive to ESD. Avoid any air gaps around the tray that otherwise can lead to ESD entry. Divert ESD into system ground by connecting the metal tray of the SIM/SD to the chassis ground or PCB ground layers.  </p></li></ul><fig id="FIG_minimize_esd_entry_points_in_the_chassis_1"><title>Minimize ESD Entry Points in the Chassis</title><image href="FIG_minimize esd entry points in the chassis_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_minimize_esd_entry_points_in_the_chassis_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
