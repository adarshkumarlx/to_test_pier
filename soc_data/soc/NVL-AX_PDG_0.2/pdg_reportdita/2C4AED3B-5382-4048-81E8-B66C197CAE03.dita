Proper ground contact of the shield is critical to ensuring shielding effectiveness. In consideration of (Î»/10) @ 7.5 GHz, the following figure shows the maximum recommended spacing between grounding pads and vias. Poor grounding contact or gaps/ seams in the shield can reduce the shielding effectiveness.
