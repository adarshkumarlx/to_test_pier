Scrambled data signals for high-speed interfaces (e.g. USB 3.0, DDR5, PCIE) are broadband, covering a wide frequency range and radio band in the GHz range. On the other hand, clock signals are highly periodic and have a relatively narrowband spectrum, which leads to the generation of harmonics. Unlike scrambled data, these harmonics are periodic and predictable.</p><table id="TABLE_3445C1D3-0288-4ECE-A849-A394F7C51782_1"><title>Recommended Noise Threshold for Wi-Fi and WWAN Radios</title><tgroup cols="3"><thead><row><entry>Noise Profile</entry><entry>Wi-Fi In-band Noise Threshold (dBm/100 kHz)</entry><entry>WWAN In-band Noise Threshold (dBm/100 kHz)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><p>Narrowband noise (&lt;= 600 kHz Bandwidth)</p></entry><entry><p>-106</p></entry><entry><p>-98</p></entry></row><row><entry><p>Broadband Noise</p></entry><entry><p>-117</p></entry><entry><p>-117</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>The table above shows the recommended noise threshold based on experimental results. By artificially changing the noise profile and level, the figures below represent the throughput and sensitivity impact on Wi-Fi and WWAN. The noise threshold is defined according to the noise level that can ensure radio performance.</p><fig id="FIG_wi-fi_throughput_degradation_by_rf_noise_level_1"><title>Wi-Fi Throughput Degradation by RF Noise Level</title><image href="FIG_wi-fi throughput degradation by rf noise level_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_wi-fi_throughput_degradation_by_rf_noise_level_1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_wwan_sensitivity_degradation_by_rf_noise_level_1"><title>WWAN Sensitivity Degradation by RF Noise Level</title><image href="FIG_wwan sensitivity degradation by rf noise level_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_wwan_sensitivity_degradation_by_rf_noise_level_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
