These decoupling capacitors may help in reducing potential NPU and GFX noise in certain scenarios such as a system with aggressive antenna placement to NPU and GFX power planes. The following table and figure show the recommended values and placement for the decoupling capacitors:</p><fig id="FIG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_npu_and_gfx_power_planes_1"><title>RF Decoupling Capacitor Guideline for NPU and GFX Power Planes</title><image href="FIG_rf decoupling capacitor guideline for npu and gfx power planes_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_rf_decoupling_capacitor_guideline_for_npu_and_gfx_power_planes_1_png" /></fig><table id="TABLE_CBBB7731-8B5E-4675-B5ED-2B978DC164C8_1" scale="60"><title>NPU and GFX Power Plane RF Capacitor Placement Guidelines</title><tgroup cols="5"><thead><row valign="top"><entry outputclass="rotate90">Case #</entry><entry outputclass="rotate90">Location of Decoupling Capacitor</entry><entry outputclass="rotate90">NPU RF Capacitors for 2.4GHz Band</entry><entry outputclass="rotate90">GFX RF Capacitors for 2.4GHz Band</entry><entry outputclass="rotate90">Comments</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><p>Case 1</p></entry><entry><p>Directly underneath pair of NPU / GFX power via and GND vias (Directly from BGAs) on the plane</p></entry><entry><p>0201 size: 6 x capacitors (Suggested value: between 22pF to 33pF)</p></entry><entry><p>0201 size: 6 x capacitors (Suggested value: between 22pF to 33pF)</p></entry><entry><p>Preferred placement for RF decoupling capacitors.Capacitors are recommended to be placed directly underneath the pair of NPU / GFX power via - GND vias at bottom layer or at least within the CPU’s shadow area.
