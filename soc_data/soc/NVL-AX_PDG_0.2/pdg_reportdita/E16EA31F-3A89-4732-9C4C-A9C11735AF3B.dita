The thermal/EMI shield solution needs to have proper electrical contact to the PCB ground layer to guarantee adequate shielding effectiveness.</p><p>An example of an EMI shield with co-optimized EMC-thermal solution consists of a large metal frame interposer that covers GPU, GDDR devices, GPU voltage regulator, CPU, DDR devices and voltage regulator. The metal frame has an electrically conductive interface and connects to the on-board GND pad opening.</p><fig id="FIG_example_implementation_of_emc-thermal_solution_1"><title>Example Implementation of EMC-Thermal Solution</title><image href="FIG_example implementation of emc-thermal solution_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_example_implementation_of_emc-thermal_solution_1_png" /></fig><fig id="FIG_metal_frame_interposer_with_electrically_conductive_interface_to_board_1"><title>Metal Frame Interposer with Electrically Conductive Interface to Board</title><image href="FIG_metal frame interposer with electrically conductive interface to board_1.png" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_metal_frame_interposer_with_electrically_conductive_interface_to_board_1_png" /></fig></section></body></topic>
