Platform noise may be guided by chassis cover towards antenna. Improved chassis design and on board shielding could isolate platform noise from interfering to the radio devices performances.</p><fig id="FIG_chassis_and_on-board_shielding_consideration_1"><title>Chassis and On-board Shielding Consideration</title><image href="FIG_chassis and on-board shielding consideration_1.jpg" scalefit="yes" id="IMG_chassis_and_on-board_shielding_consideration_1_jpg" /></fig></section></body></topic>
